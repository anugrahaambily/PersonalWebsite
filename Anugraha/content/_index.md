❝Based on my experiences so far, I have noticed that the present learning methodology emphasizes more on texts rather than illustrations. But I suggest equal weightage on both. Present day text books, especially for school going students, have long endless paras and barely a figure. On the other hand a fully descriptive illustration too can kill the curiosity and eagerness in students. Though a minor fraction of students can deal with the lengthy texts, a larger fraction would prefer pictorial representation. Ideally one's memory runs long term on those concepts which are developed via creative thinking. An effective illustration can cover wide aspects which can develop curiosity and thinking potential in students.  

 Illustrations could be used to design a series of activities which can eventually enhance the creativity and logical thinking in students. Tasks behind developing such illustration based activities is not easy. It requires thorough interaction with students of all age groups and it's important to identify their requirements as well. This could be made possible through a comprehensive and continuous effort. I have myself set my goal towards that end.❞
