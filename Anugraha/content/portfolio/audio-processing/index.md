This work was prepared as cover for the official website of a PhD student at Queen's Mary University, London. His work is mainly focused on audio processing. 
Imagine you are standing in the middle of a street in a city. close your eyes= what do you hear? Perhaps car..bus..footsteps..beeps...human speech...music ... siren..??Your sense of hearing tells you what is happening around you, without any sense of vision, right?! How do computers/mobile gadgets make sense of these urban sounds - "machine listening" and then how could we make use of machine listening.
