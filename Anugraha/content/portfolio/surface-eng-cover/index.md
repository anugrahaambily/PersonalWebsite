This work was prepared as a cover for the official website of Dr T N Narayanan's research group in which I am also included as a Junior Research Fellow. 
Our research focus is on the development of functional mesoscopic interfaces, and probing the novel and unprecedented phenomena emanating from these junctions. Development of novel interfaces from 1D, 2D and 3D nanomaterials is one of the key research focuses. Interface induced heterogeneous catalysis control is another core theme of our research. Electron transport properties of mesoscale junctions and their interactions with light are other areas of interest.
