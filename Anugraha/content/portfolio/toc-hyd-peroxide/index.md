This was designed as a TOC for a paper on ' Electrochemically derived functionalized graphene for bulk production of hydrogen peroxide'.
  Oxidized graphitic carbon-based materials have been recently proposed as an alternative to metal-based catalysts in the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and in this work we unravel the role of C=O groups in graphene towards sustainable peroxide formation
