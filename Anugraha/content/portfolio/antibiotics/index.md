" Drug resistance imposes huge costs on health systems and is taking a growing-and unnecessary-toll in lives and threatening to roll back much of the progress we have made" - Ban Ki-moon

What is antibiotic resistance? How does one develop antibiotic resistance? 

Do you remember taking an Amoxicillin pill for the very first time, and how better you felt in an hour? If you still feel the same after taking those, you should be happy! Because either over prescription or incompletion of a prescribed antibiotic course can lead to "antibiotic resistance". 
Antibiotic resistance, which is a subset of antimicrobial resistance, is the ability of a bacteria to resist the effects of antibiotics that once could successfully treat them. Improper use of antibiotics can cause severe damage to the human gut microbiome. 
'It appears that we are providing opportunity for harmless microbes to transform into deadly superbugs!'
