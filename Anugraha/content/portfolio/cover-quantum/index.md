This work was prepared as a cover for an upcoming journal on Quantum materials for catalysis. 
Some of the materials such as Perovskites, defective Graphene oxide, Molybdenum disulfide, Mexene etc with interesting electronic and topological properties, are used in different applications in various catalyst
